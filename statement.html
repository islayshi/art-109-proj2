  <p> Hi and thank you to those who have checked out this page!</p>


  <p>Although I have played less games comapred to other people, gaming has always been an important part of my life. Although some may dismiss them as trivial hobbies, gaming undoubtedly always requires all kinds of arts and sciences. Whether it be user interace interaction, visual development, and more, video games are all encompassing of those elements. So I figured I would like to share my own backlog for this project. </p>

  <p> The main library I used was paper.js, which uses vector graphics. I had a hard time getting used to it, but eventually found all my answers through careful research. I wish the program was more modular, but I am happy with what I have so far.</p>

  <p> Thank you for visiting! </p>
